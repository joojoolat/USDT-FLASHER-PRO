## ✨ Features

### ⚡ Multi-Network Flash Engine
Send USDT flash transactions across **5 major blockchain networks** — TRC-20 (TRON), ERC-20 (Ethereum), BEP-20 (BSC), Solana, and Polygon — all from a single interface.

### 🔄 Real-Time Terminal Log
Watch every step of the transaction process live in a built-in hacker-style terminal with detailed step-by-step output including TX hashes, block numbers, and confirmation status.

### 📊 Live Dashboard & Stats
Real-time stat cards showing your available balance, total flashed amount, and transaction count — updated instantly after every operation.

### 🕵️ Stealth Mode
Covert transaction execution with full sender metadata obfuscation for maximum privacy during operations.

### 🌐 Proxy Routing (TOR)
Built-in TOR circuit routing through multiple hops for enhanced anonymity. Auto-generates proxy IPs and establishes multi-hop circuits.

### 🔐 ECDSA-secp256k1 Signing
All transactions are signed using industry-standard ECDSA-secp256k1 cryptography with unique nonces for each operation.

### ✂️ Split Transactions
Automatically divide large flash amounts into multiple smaller sub-transactions, each with its own unique TX hash — making operations harder to trace.

### ⏱️ Custom Confirmations (1–100)
Full control over the number of blockchain confirmations per transaction. Monitor each confirmation in real-time through the terminal.

### 📅 Flash Duration Control (1–365 Days)
Configure exactly how long each flash transaction remains valid on the network — from 1 day up to a full year.

### 💲 Quick Amount Selection
Preset amount buttons for fast operation — **1K, 5K, 10K, 50K, and 100K** USDT with a single click.

### 📋 Clipboard Integration
One-click paste for wallet addresses directly from your clipboard. No manual typing needed.

### 📜 Full Transaction History
Complete searchable history of all executed flash transactions with TX hashes, wallet addresses, amounts, block numbers, networks, and timestamps.

### 🟢 Live Node Connection Status
Real-time display of connected blockchain nodes worldwide with animated pulse indicator.

### 🌙 Professional Dark UI
Premium dark-themed interface with matrix rain effects, glowing buttons, animated pulse dots, and smooth transitions — designed for extended use.

### 🖥️ Standalone EXE
Runs as a single portable `.exe` file on Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 (64-bit). No Python or dependency installation required.
